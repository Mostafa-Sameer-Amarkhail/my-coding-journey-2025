# My CS50 Python Journey 2025

Tracking my daily progress as I learn Python through CS50P.

## Day 1: Problem Set 0 (Indoor Voice)

* **Concepts Learned:**
    *   **Functions:** I learned about `input()` to get user data and `print()` to display output.
    *   **String Methods:** I used `.lower()` to convert text to lowercase and `.strip()` to remove whitespace.
* **Practice:** I wrote a simple script that asks for a user's name and prints it in lowercase.
* **Status:** Completed the lecture and the first problem set using `submit50`!
